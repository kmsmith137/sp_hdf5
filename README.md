## sp_hdf5

Header-only C++ library containing "thin" wrappers around libhdf5_cpp

To do list:
   - Error messages could be improved
   - Not very feature-complete.  Some missing features offhand:
       - Retrieve list of datasets/groups/etc
       - Partial reads/writes
       - Extendable reads/writes
       - String-valued datasets
